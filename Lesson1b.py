#  Using variables we create a simple interest calculator
#  Formula: PRT/100
#  Pseudo code - step by step flow/description of your program
#  Step 1: we create 3 variables principle , rate, time and their values
#  Step 2: Using the formula find simple interest,
#  Step 3: Store the interest obtained from step 2 in a variable
#  Step 4: Print/Output the interest  from step 3


#  real code
# Step 1
principle = 56000
rate = 1.5
time = 3

#  Step 2/3, we store the interest obtained in variable
interest = principle * rate * time/100
#  Step 4 , print your interest/answer
print('Your Simple Interest is KES ', interest)
