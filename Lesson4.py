# Today , we do while loop
# While Loop repeats a task n-times
# With while a loop you can do an infinite loop(loops forever)

#  There are three steps you need to do:
#  1. Create a variable to start your loop i.e x = 0
#  2. Set a condition, loop will run only if this condition is true
#     The loop will not run if the condition is false
#  3. Increment - to increase

# While loop version
#  Step 1
x = 0
# Step 2
while(x < 10):
    print('Looping with while', x)
    x = x + 1




# The for loop version
for i in range(0,10):
    print('Looping with for ', i)



# The only difference is while loop can be infinite (loop forever)
