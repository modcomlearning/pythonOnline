# Loops Statements
# There are two types of loops - for , while
# Loops repeat a task n-times
# We start with a FOR loop
for i in range(0, 2000, 1):  # start, stop, step/jump
    print('Testing', i)



#  For loop can be used to read data from databases
#  used in sending bulk sms
#  scheduling tasks that repeat themselves
#  Any other that need to be repeated
