#  We do variables
#  variables are used to store values
#  think of variables as a container of values
#  to create variables you need to give them names i.e age = 40
#  age = 40 means  variable age contains 40, so age is name, 40 is value
#  Variables types :
#  1. int - this is an integer, whole numbers positive or negative
#  2. float - this is a number with decimal
#  3. string - this includes letters, symbols, numbers - they must be quoted

#  lets do an int
marks = 400
age = 25

#  lets do float
weight = 56.5
height = 1.5

#  lets do string, symbols
county = "Nakuru"
town = 'Eldoret'
name = 'ann'
password = 'jhdj&%&*%'

#  print the variables
print(marks)
print(age)
print(password)

#  Rules to come with variable names.
# 1. use any name, its up to the developer to come up with a name
# 2. don't start with a number i.e 5age its wrong, age5 is okay
# 3. don't have a space in a variable name i.e pass word is wrong, use underscore
#  i.e pass_word is okay, pass-word is wrong, only underscore symbol
# 4. variables names are CASE sensitive  - age is different from Age
# 5. in short, use A-z for variables, underscore where needed
